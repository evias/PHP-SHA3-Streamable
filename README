Streamable SHA-3 in pure PHP!

* SHA3-224
* SHA3-256 (for 128-bit security like SHA2-256)
* SHA3-384
* SHA3-512 (for 256-bit security like SHA2-512)

Unbounded output:
* SHAKE128 (Use at least 256 bits of output for 128-bit security)
* SHAKE256 (Use at least 512 bits of output for 256-bit security)

Amazingly, PHP 5.2 (EOL in January 2011) as well as PHP 7.0 is supported.
Please report if you find a problem.
Note that SHA-3 is considably slower than SHA-2 in *software*, not to mention
PHP's notable slowness. PHP 7.0 is 4x the speed of PHP 5.6.
TODO: Optimize for speed, while defending against timing attacks

Usage:
$shake128 = SHA3::init (SHA3::SHAKE128);
$shake128->absorb ('The quick brown fox ');
$shake128->absorb ('jumps over the lazy dog');
// Squeeze 256 bits of hash output!
echo bin2hex ($shake128->squeeze (32)) . PHP_EOL;
// f4202e3c5852f9182a0430fd8144f0a74b95e7417ecae17db0f8cfeed0e3e66e
// more output possible
